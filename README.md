# User Guide
Import a JPG image by clicking 'File' in the menu bar. To get the area of the choosen cell, choose the area of the image first(eg. 100x100 micrometer, etc.) and click calculate. Now click on any cell in the image to get its area. The cells clicked are numberd with an ID. The created table with ID and area can be copied to the clip board for later use. 
Note: If the area of the image is wrong, then the values seen for the cell's area will not be the true value.
